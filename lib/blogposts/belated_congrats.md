*Wow*

One year ago I was just barely trying to fight my way through the first few weeks of DevBootcamp. I was foolish. I thought I knew everthing about how to do what it is I need to do in order to learn and keep learning.

*I had no clue.*

I had no clue what was going to happen to me. I had no idea where I was going. I was barely writing command line programs and had written some pretty basic html. I kind of knew some Ruby, was learning Javascript, had even written a few lines of JQuery.

We built a few projects. Snack overflow was a fun one. Go Park Yourself was great too. We built a sudoku solver. I made an app to help learn how to meditate. I even rebuilt a game I was obsessed with at the time.

I also had bedbugs, which totally suck. And I had long fallen out of love with my city. Cities in general, really.

So when we presented Go Park Yourself as our final project, I knew I was looking for a job outside of NYC. And where else to go but Silicon Valley? Thats how I ended up getting a job with Betterhelp and living in sunny San Jose. We do online mental health counseling. Which is really great. We actually help people with what we do. We also do all of this with PHP, which I had never written a lick of before I started.

I had never lived west of the Mississippi. I had never had a full time job before. I hadn't owned a car in my adult life.

And now I do.

So remember that just cause you haven't done something doesn't mean you can't or won't. It just means you haven't yet.

Make Awesome.
