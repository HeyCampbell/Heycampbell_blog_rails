_A brief allegory on the teaching style of Dev Bootcamp_

Take this block of metal. Because I'm trying to teach you soemthing. Just take the metal. Does it look like a car? No. Not yet.

  Here, use this machine over here. Put the block here. Start it spinning. Now use this tool and start cuting it. There's a bunch of other tools right here, but we'll just use this one for now. Good job, one more little cut right there and you're done. Hold it in you hand. Feel the wieght of it. You made that screw. Yourself.

  Now throw it on that pile of screws we've already got. Screws are easy to get. You might not ever make another one.

  But, here, take this block of metal. Does it look like a car? No. Not yet. But let's use this other machine. There. nice and flattened out. Put a bend there, another one there. use a few screws and connect it with that other piece there.

  Behold, your car door. You made that. Now, here is the button that starts the machine that automatically makes the car doors. You don't need to make any more doors.

  But here, take this block of metal. Put it in that machine there, let it smelt down and cast the engine. Put the hood on there. Yeah the doors connect just by, you got it.

  Nicely done. You've built your first car. It's beautiful.

  But somewhere, deep down into the heart of the machine, near the transmission, there's something amiss. A broken screw. And no more on the shelf.

  But here, take this block of metal.
