_A brief allegory on the teaching style of Dev Bootcamp_

Take this block of metal. Because I'm trying to teach you something. Just take the metal. Does it look like a car? No. Not yet.

  Here, use this machine over here. Put the block here. Start it spinning. Now use this tool and start cutting it. There's a bunch of other tools right here, but we'll just use this one for now. Good job, one more little cut right there and you're done. Hold it in you hand. Feel the weight of it. You made that screw. Yourself. It feels nice, right?

  But, here, take this block of metal. Does it look like a car? No. Not yet. But let's use this other machine. There. Nice and flattened out. Put a bend there, another one there. use a few of those screws and connect it with that other piece there. no you don't need to make these screws, we have a whole box of them right there.

  Behold, a car door. You made that. And you know every little bolt and weld. You spent all day building this door. It's amazing.

  But here, take this block of metal. Put it in that machine there, let it smelt down and cast the engine. Put the hood on there. Yeah the doors connect just by, you got it.

  Nicely done. You've built your first car. It's beautiful.

  But somewhere, deep down into the heart of the machine, near the transmission, there's something amiss. A broken screw. And we need to drive this sucker home.

  But here, take this block of metal.

  Make Awesome.
