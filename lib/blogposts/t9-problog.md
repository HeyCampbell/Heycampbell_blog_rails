This website was created to keep a record of my time here at DBCs phase 0. It was literally the first thing I ever made with HTML, outside of a few exercises. And I put a ton of energy into it. Probably spent about 10 hrs on it during the Week 2 asignment. And in the end I had a working, single page site.

Which I hated.

Luckily, we were encouraged to revisit and make some changes to the site this week. I was able to add some things that I think make the site much nicer. I have not yet integrated a framework into the site, which I would like to do at some point. I spent the time I could have been doing that learning about Rails. THIS is what I really want to integrate. Because Right now, the blogs are served up in a very outdated manner.

I know we'll be picking up some Rails knowledge in the next few weeks, so once we've done that, keep tuned here for a new, updated site, complete with a Dynamic web app.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go try to give my family some good memories of me as they will apparently not see me for while.

Make Awesome
