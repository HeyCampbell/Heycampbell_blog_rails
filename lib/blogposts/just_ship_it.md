#So you've written some code.#

Congratulations! You've just done what most people will never do. You've put words into a file and a machine will read those words and do cool shit (In the end, thats our job. How cool is that?). Now, the toughest part is in your hands. It's not done yet. The test suite is passing, but you know the tests don't cover everything. You still want to add in the combobulator module. And the sparsonification feature is not working yet, this story is kind of useless without it. And good God did you really write it that way? There is some serious refactoring that needs to happen. That could take all day. But the tests that are written all pass. Your job sometimes is to just get the tests passing.

So why can't you ship?

#####Yes, you could have done that better
#####Yes, there are things that are not implemented yet.
#####No, you cannot wait until tomorrow.

  Just ship it. It's that simple. Until you ship, everything you've done today is null. Your code is not perfect. It will never be perfect. Thats the beauty of code. It's like love, as soon as you think you have it figured out, you find out it runs deeper than you'd ever guessed, with nuances and better ways to write it. Maybe you valued readability for a while. Now concision is the most important thing. Your style changes. Don't make your code wait around.

Waiting until everything is perfect to ship is a great way to procrastinate. You don't have to take the chance someone doesn't like your code as long as they can't see it. It's defensive. It's a great tactic if your goal is to just float by and hopefully collect a paycheck for contributing practically nothing.

####Just ship it.

If you don't ship it, your manager will ask you why. You tell them it's to make the code better before you commit. Now they expect more from you. Which means you need to make sure it's perfect before you ship. Which means you're not shipping tomorrow either. Which raises their expectations and hackles. Which makes you more scared to ship, which delays shipping, which upsets your manager, round and round, until the only way out is to fake your own death and move to Belgrade for a few years to lay low.

###Just ship it.

The worst that happens is that it's total crap. And through exposing your weaknesses, you get some help. Whether it's guidance, education, support, anything. Now your manager knows what your strengths are and where you need help. This means she can help make sure you can succeed in the future.

I've published this blog. Do I think it's perfect? Oh hell no. There is so much I want to make better. the only thing I love on this blog right now is that I made a hamburger menu icon that actually turns into a hamburger. The rest? It's a work in progress. Just like us. Agile methodology is popular because it's humanistic. Our code should be Agile as well. It's too long that we are separating our software from the way people work. We grow and learn, there is no reason why our code can't.

Really, though, your code is pretty good. Get out of your head and just do what you're good at. Which is writing code. Now stop waiting and start shipping.

Make Awesome
